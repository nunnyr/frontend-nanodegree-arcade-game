## Instructions

Welcome to the Classic Arcade Game. Try to reach the water without colliding with any bugs!

You can move your Hero using the arrow keys (up, left, down, right).
Once you reach the water you have the option to start again.

Be careful with running into enemies, you'll start from the beginning if they catch you.

Good luck!
